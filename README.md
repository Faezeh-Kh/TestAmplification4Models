# Automated Test Amplification 
This repository shares the experimental results of our submission to MODELS 2022 conference as follows:
- *xDSLs_Implementation*: The main artifacts of the xDSL definition including, abstract syntax (.ecore files), operational semantics (.xtend files), behavioral interface (.bi files), and mutation operators (.mutator file) for each of the considered xDSLs: xArduino and xPSSM. 
Note that this folder does not provide the reproducible projects to prevent identity revealing. We will provide the complete implementation after the double-blind review period.  
- *xModels&Tests*: A set of models conforming to each xDSL, a test suite for each xModel, and the test amplification result for each test suite.
